# Seaside Chats

This is a repo that will be used to test/demo aspects of github project managament and version control in our seaside chats. 

[For more info check out the wiki](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/seaside/wiki)

In these meetings we will follow a code of conduct (below) to ensure that all participates feel welcome to contribute to the conversations we have around project management, workflows and data. 

Hopefully this will also facilitate conversations about best practices and branch specific strategies for handling projects and products using Github.

## Code of Conduct

This is the initial list of participation guidelines grabbed from the Openscapes workshop. 

- Be respectful and value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints.
- Be direct but professional; we cannot withhold hard truths.
- Be inclusive and help new perspectives be heard.
- Be open to learning from others.
- Lead by example and match your actions with your words.
